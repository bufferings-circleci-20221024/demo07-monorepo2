# demo07-monorepo2

[demo05-monorepo1](https://github.com/bufferings-circleci-20221024/demo05-monorepo1) introduced [config-splitting](https://circleci.com/developer/ja/orbs/orb/circle-makotom-orbs/config-splitting) to split config into each module.

This demo is demo05 plus path-filtering. The [config-splitting](https://circleci.com/developer/ja/orbs/orb/circle-makotom-orbs/config-splitting) orb contains path-filtering feature so that we can specify which module to be built.

The reference project for this demo: [circle-select-split-config](https://github.com/circle-makotom/circle-select-split-config)
